# Super Mario App for Android

Welcome to my Android Super Mario app! This is my first attempt at creating a phone app. For this project, I decided to build a version of Super Mario. My version has 3 levels,

# Installation and Deployment
* Install Android Studios
* Open android studios and complete the setup
* Start Android Studios, and select **Check out project from Version Control (Git)**
* Enter the following URL, and then clone the repository: https://github.com/kunalbuty/Super_Mario_Android.git
* Click the **Run App** button, and select a virtual device. You may have to set up a new one. In that case, I would recommend the Google Pixel.
* Click OK. A new window should now launch with the Game working!

## Bugs
Since this was my first attempt at an app, there were a vast amount of bugs. I do not plan on fixing these since there are so many that it would be easier to just start from scratch. However, I will take this as a learning experience, and make better programs in the future.
